This Dagster module is designed to house assets for the four Gospel books in Greek: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. It sources CSV data from the [bible](https://github.com/ivandustin/bible) project, converting it into Pandas DataFrames. These assets form the basis for further advanced data processing tasks.
